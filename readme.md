## How to contribute

The basics are below, but see [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

1. Fork the project
2. Add or edit a route by editing and following the format in `routes.geojson` (hint, it's GeoJSON)
3. Submit a pull request

## Validating the GeoJSON

When you submit a pull request, it will automatically check to ensure your GeoJSON is valid.

If you'd like to check yourself, you can run `./script/cibuild` locally, or pasting the contents of `routes.geojson` into http://geojsonlint.com.
